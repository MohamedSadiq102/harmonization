    The Data Model is intended to describe the mechanical, electrical and
    thermal characteristics of photo-voltaic panels according to *STC - Standard
    Test Condition* and *NOCT - Normal Operating Cell Temperature*. *Remark* :
    This Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the
    `Photovoltaic Device`  or as a sub-entity of the Data Model  `DEVICE` using
    a reference by the `refDevice` attribute. The measures performed for STC and
    NOCT are `Pmax` (Maximum Nominal Power), `Umpp` (Optimal operating voltage),
    `Impp` (Optimal Operating Current), `Uoc` (Open Circuit Voltage), `Isc`
    (Short Circuit Current). *Additional Information about Data Model:* This
    Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the device
    [PHOTOVOLTAIC] or as a sub-entity of the Data Model [DEVICE] using a
    reference by the `refDevice` attribute.
